# PriceRater

This project started off as a way to learn web scraping, and has turned into a full web scraping project with API, data storage and database connectivity. It is still a slow work in progress. 

The idea came due to the cost of living, and supermarkets putting their prices through the roof. I used to use MySupermarket to compare prices, and nothing really came close after that disappeared to what I wanted. The idea is to have categories of products, for examples, potatoes, and each category has up to 4 retailers to compare with. The automation of web scraping would then allow me to see which supermarket has the cheapest potatoes, and I could then develop a list to save money on each product. 

That is still the end goal, but for now I will continue developing and turn this readme into an actual readme for the project when it has more bulk to it.
